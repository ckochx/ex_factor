# ExFactor

ExFactor is a refactoring helper. Given a module, function name, and arity, it will locate all uses of
that function, change the callers to a new module and/or function name, and move the function from the original location
to a new file/module. At this time, ExFactor cannot change the function arity.


### Example
```elixir
mix exfactor -m MyApp.MyMod -f [my_func: 2] -mm MyApp.MyNewMod -mf :my_new_func
```

## Installation
